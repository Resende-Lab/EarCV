-------------------------------------------------------
A python-based tool for automated maize ear phenotyping
-------------------------------------------------------

This tool allows the user to rapidly extract features from images containing maize ears against a uniform background. It was designed with the intention of facilitating analysis of thousands of images with a single command prompt. As output, this tool creates a .csv with features for each ear found in the input image(s) and prints several proofs to monitor tool performance.

-----------
Quick Start
-----------

CLONE REPO::

 git clone https://github.com/juang0nzal3z/EarCV.git

Running tests from the main ''EarCV/'' folder contianing this repo. Let's use images within the ''/test/'' folder as examples.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Simplest case:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Image only containing a single ear::

	python ./src/main.py -i ./test/IN/test_img_1.JPG -o ./test/OUT/

Output:

.. image:: ./test/OUT/01_Proofs/test_img_1_proof.png
	:height: 2944 px
	:width: 2949 px
	:scale: 1 %
	:alt: alternate text
	:align: right

.. image:: ./test/OUT/03_Ear_Proofs/test_img_1_ear_1_proof1.png
	:height: 100 px
	:width: 200 px
	:scale: 10 %
	:alt: alternate text
	:align: right


Now lets run the same image with default cob and shank segmentation::

	python ./src/main.py -i ./test/IN/test_img_1.JPG -o ./test/OUT/ -t 0 0 0 0 -b 0 0 0 0 

Output:

.. image:: ./test/OUT/03_Ear_Proofs/test_img_1_ear_1_proof2.png
	:height: 100px
	:width: 200 px
	:scale: 10 %
	:alt: alternate text
	:align: right

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Full feature case:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's run an image with all of the features using default settings::

	python ./src/main.py -i ./test/IN/test_img_2.png -o ./test/OUT/ -qr -clr ./test/IN/clrchr.png -ppm 10 -t 0 0 0 0 -b 0 0 0 0

Output:

.. image:: ./test/OUT/01_Proofs/test_img_2_proof.png
    :alt: alternate text

Usage
-----

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Installation & Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Just download this repo and make sure you have all the dependencies installed on your python environment of choice. This tool uses the folowing packages:

* OpenCV 2
* numpy
* scipy
* pyzbar (optional, QR code module)
* plantcv (optional, Color correction module)

^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Main pipeline
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This tool uses any standard image format (.jpg, .jpeg, .png, or .tiff). To start, the main function does the following:

* Segments ears photographed against a uniform background
	- Background can be any color insofar it contrasts well with the ears.
	- Algorithm can take any number of ears, in any configuration or arrangment.
	- Ears may touch slightly in the image.
	- Ears may have silk and other debri.

* For each ear:
	- Extracts basic morphological features
	- Segments cob and shank from kernels
	- Extracts kernel features
	- (in development) Estimates Kernel Row Number
	- (in development) Predicts USDA quality Grade
 
^^^^^
Input
^^^^^

	Required:

	-i, --image      	   Path to input image file, required. Accepted formats: 'tiff', 'jpeg', 'bmp', 'png'.

	Optional:

	-o, --OUTDIR     	   Provide path to directory to save proofs, logfile, and output CSVs. Default: Will save in current directory if not provided.

	-ns, --no_save   	   Default saves proofs and output CSVs. Raise flag to stop saving.

	-np, --no_proof		   Default prints proofs on screen. Raise flag to stop printing proofs.

	-D, --debug     	   Raise flag to print intermediate images throughout analysis. Useful for troubleshooting.

For complete usage documentation run::

	python ./src/main.py -h

^^^^^
Output
^^^^^
The output structure is as follows::

	./OUT/
	|--- 01_Proofs/
	|--- 02_Ear_ROIs/
	|--- 03_Ear_Proofs/
	|--- EarCV.log
	|--- qrcode.csv
	|--- color_check.csv
	|--- features.csv

* Proofs
	Use proofs to monitor performance. ''01_Proofs'' documents qr code extraction, color correction, pixels per metric calculation, and ear segmentation. ''02_Ear_ROIs'' contains the region of interest for each segmented ear. ''03_Ear_Proofs'' conatins a proof for each individual ear showing various feature extraction results. 
* EarCV.log
	Every time you run the script, the terminal prints a log of what is happening under the hood.
* qrcode.csv
	File with the image name and the corresponding information found in QR code.
* color_check.csv
	File with color correction preformance metrics based on root mean squared differences in color.
* features.csv
	File with the ear features as columns and ears as rows.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Optional modules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* QR code extraction
	- Helps you keep track of who is what in what image in your experiment.
	- Scans image for QR code and returns found information.
* Color correction
	- Standizes colors across any number of images to make robust color comparisons.
	- Performs color correction on images using a color checker.
* Pixels per metric conversion
	- Want your morphemetric measurements in inches? centimeters?
	- Converts pixel measurements into any unit of length or area.
	- Calculates the pixels per metric using a solid color square in the input image of known dimensions.
